# Bank-FD-Subscription-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
## Overview

This project analyzes bank marketing campaign data to determine which customers are likely to purchase a Fixed Deposit. The dataset is processed, cleaned, encoded, and used to train multiple classification models. Their performances are compared to identify the most effective algorithm for prediction.

## Objectives

- Analyze customer attributes influencing FD purchase decisions

- Preprocess and handle missing values in the dataset

- Encode categorical features for model compatibility

- Train multiple machine learning models

- Compare results using accuracy and evaluation metrics

- Identify the best-performing model for FD prediction

## Features

- Data loading and inspection

- Handling missing values

- Label encoding for categorical data

- Feature scaling

- Exploratory Data Analysis

- Train-test splitting

- Model training and evaluation

- Accuracy comparison and confusion matrix generation

## Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- AdaBoost Classifier (Best Performer)

Model performance was evaluated based on accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices. AdaBoost achieved the highest accuracy among all tested models.

## Results

- Multiple ML models trained and evaluated

- Accuracy values compared using bar plots

- Confusion matrix visualized for the best-performing model

- AdaBoost achieved the best accuracy for prediction
